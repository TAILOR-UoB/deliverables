# TAILOR #

TAILOR is an ICT-48 Network of AI Research Excellence Centers funded by EU Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme GA No 952215. More details can be found at <https://tailor-network.eu/>.

# Workpackage 9: Network Collaboration #

Collaboration is at the heart of the TAILOR network, and the aim of this work package is to promote and support interaction and collaboration between network partners through tools, development of training material, organisation of training events, PhD and staff exchanges, etc. The overall goals are to foster excellence through shared knowledge and vision, to support a sustainable research capacity in Trustworthy AI which has critical mass and can effectively interact with European funding mechanisms, and to establish a healthy pipeline of future talent. The tasks in this work package will be coordinated with the CSA in order to maximise visibility and impact, reduce overhead, and align with the other RIAs.
